      "**AI-powered robotics are building smarter structures in B.C.'s backyard - BC News**\n",
      "Federal Liberal leadership candidate Mark Carney visited the University of British Columbia's Smart Structures laboratory, where he was briefed on new technologies that could help tackle Canada's housing shortage. The lab is pioneering new construction practices, including modular, robotic, and AI-driven methods. Professor Tony Yang said, 'We can ensure these new-generation buildings are smarter, more resilient, more carbon-neutral and, in fact, more economical to build.' The lab's innovations could help Canada meet its goal of building 3.9 million new homes by 2031. Yang believes that the technology could result in similar time and cost savings as seen in China, where a 15-storey building can be constructed in just one week. The goal of automation is not to replace construction workers, but to deploy them more efficiently and productively. Yang also noted B.C.'s shortage of skilled construction labour, which the new technology can help alleviate. The lab has already partnered with Rogers Communications Inc. to develop next-generation communication protocols and plans to build out a production line and supply chain to allow its new methods to be implemented and tested on a larger scale.\n",

      "The Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts a net gain of 78 million jobs by 2030, with 170 million new gigs created and 92 million that will disappear. The report highlights five big forces shaping the job world: technology, geoeconomic fragmentation, economic uncertainty, demographic shifts, and the green transition. Employers are looking for skills like analytical thinking, resilience, and leadership, and are shifting to new roles such as AI specialists and green energy experts. Companies are upskilling their teams, hiring fresh talent, and shifting people to growing areas. The report emphasizes the importance of training and adapting to the changing job market, with 50% of workers already training up and 39% of current skills expected to be outdated by 2030. 'The future's not coming -- it's already here. So get ready, So you'll not just survive, but you'll thrive.'\n",

      "Elon Musk predicts that AI will surpass human intelligence by 2029, with a 20% chance of leading to human extinction. He expresses concerns about OpenAI's shift towards a profit-driven model and criticizes Google's AI values, highlighting the dangers of programming AI with overly specific parameters. Meanwhile, Google co-founder Sergey Brin urges employees to work 60-hour weeks to advance AI development and regain Google's technological leadership in the competitive AI landscape. Brin's call to action reflects a broader industry trend of reevaluating remote work policies, with companies like Amazon and AT&T shifting back to in-office work to enhance productivity and innovation.\n",

      "According to a report by the World Economic Forum (WEF), by 2030, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to create 170 million new job opportunities, while automation will replace 92 million jobs, ultimately adding 78 million new employment opportunities. The report emphasizes that AI will fundamentally change the way many industries work, particularly in the public sector, real estate, services, and education. It is predicted that in the next five years, most work in these areas will shift towards automation. The report notes that many public sector workflows are currently manual, but it is expected that two-thirds of work will be automated in the next five years, significantly impacting work methods and daily tool usage. Natasha Friis Saxberg, executive director of the Danish IT industry association, stated, 'Many companies will delegate AI learning to employees, but as AI technology rapidly develops, companies must accelerate employee skill upgrades, or they will be surpassed by global competitors.' \n",

      "**Bill Gates Recommends Book on AI, Predicts Massive Changes in Jobs**\n",
      "Bill Gates believes that everyone should read his favorite book on artificial intelligence, which predicts that AI will change the shape of most jobs in almost every industry within the next five years, according to a report by CBS News. The book, 'The Next Wave: Technology and Power and the Greatest Challenge of the 21st Century', was written by Mustafa Suleyman, a pioneer in AI and the founder of the research lab DeepMind, which was sold to Google in 2014 and is now the executive director of Microsoft AI. Gates wrote on his blog last month: 'It is the book that I recommend more than any other book on AI - to heads of state, business leaders, and anyone else who asks - because it provides something rare: a clear vision of both the extraordinary opportunities and the real risks of the future.' In the book, Suleyman predicts that the rapid development of AI will change the way almost every industry works. He cites a 2023 study by McKinsey, which estimated that nearly half of all 'work activities' will become automated by 2030. Suleyman writes that the consequences of AI will be 'extremely destabilizing' for hundreds of millions of people who will need, at the very least, to be retrained and transition to new types of work. According to McKinsey, more than 400 million workers worldwide may need to transition to new jobs or roles. Suleyman says that AI will help workers become more efficient, as it already has in some cases, but only initially. He explains that 'these tools will only augment human intelligence temporarily. They will make us more intelligent and efficient for a while, and they will open up huge amounts of economic growth, but they will replace labor essentially.' How to prepare for the impact of AI on the workforce? Suleyman notes that from 'physical manufacturing' to 'cognitive work', the AI revolution will touch almost every industry. In the end, there will be 'few areas' where humans will be able to surpass machines. AI will quickly surpass human workers in office tasks such as administration, customer service, and content creation, according to Suleyman. He points out that the increase in inputs is likely to lead to a reality where employers will create millions of new jobs in response to economic growth. However, Suleyman notes that all this work will not go to humans: employers will choose 'very low-cost incentives' whenever possible. Some jobs are harder for AI to replicate. These include skilled trades such as plumbers and electricians, as well as office roles that rely heavily on social skills, critical thinking, and creativity. However, it is likely that everyone will need to upgrade their skills - and learn how to integrate this type of technology into their current jobs, as AI services spread across all industries over the coming years. Suleyman writes that many others will need to transition to entirely new jobs. This transformation is already underway. In 2023, a survey by EY found that 41% of American companies surveyed were implementing plans to train employees to work with AI products. According to a survey by Slack Workforce Lab in March 2024 of over 10,000 professionals, the key AI skills - such as rapid prototyping, machine learning, and data literacy - are a major factor in hiring for nearly 70% of employers. The massive challenge posed by AI to jobs. Some experts suggest that the economic benefits of AI will create enough new jobs to outweigh those lost. AI will create 78 million more jobs than it replaces by 2030, and the future of work will revolve around collaboration between humans and machines, according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2025 report earlier this year. Even the optimists about AI agree that the massive changes in how people work are likely to lead to a period of dramatic transformation. In his book, Suleyman predicts that the new jobs enabled by AI developments will not come soon enough to save large parts of the global workforce. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion with MIT President Sally Kornbluth in May 2024 that AI 'will kill a lot of current jobs, (and) there will be categories of jobs that will disappear completely.' 'Innovative treatments' and 'innovative solutions' and other benefits. Suleyman and Gates remain generally optimistic about the ability of AI to change people's lives for the better. Gates wrote last month that if workers and leaders prepare for massive changes, everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of 'innovative treatments for deadly diseases, innovative solutions to climate change, and high-quality education for all.' To achieve this better scenario, humans need to adopt AI by learning how to work with new technologies while implementing them in their daily lives and careers. This can start by exploring free online AI services such as 'Chat GPT' or other large language models that use AI. More advanced options include taking online courses to learn AI skills such as rapid prototyping. Suleyman emphasizes that 'this is a massive challenge that will determine, without exaggeration, the quality and nature of life in this century and the next.'\n",

      "**Artificial Intelligence to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, Report Says**\n",
      "The World Economic Forum (WEF) has recently released the Future of Jobs Report 2025, which extensively analyzes global trends in the labor market and predicts their impact on jobs, skills, and worker transformation strategies in 2025-2030. A significant part of the report is dedicated to the role of artificial intelligence in the world's workforce. According to the report, the most significant trends in the labor market in 2025-2030 are: technological advancements, economic turbulence, green energy, lack of security, and an aging population. The report is based on surveys of over 1,000 employers representing over 14 million workers in 22 industry clusters and 55 economies worldwide. The authors of the report also collaborated with platforms such as Coursera, LinkedIn, and Indeed to supplement the survey results with real data on employment trends. The report predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 170 million new jobs created, with AI playing a key role. However, 92 million roles will be replaced, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs. Technological changes remain the main driver of changes, with the expansion of digital access creating and displacing more jobs than any other macro-trend. AI and information technologies can provide 11 million new jobs, despite the expected displacement of 9 million. Meanwhile, robotics and autonomous systems will become the largest reducer, reducing the number of jobs by 5 million. For example, since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investment in AI has increased by almost eight times, accompanied by increased funding for server infrastructure and energy systems to support AI systems. Although information technologies are leaders in the implementation of AI, the real sector of the economy, including industries such as construction and manufacturing, lags behind. Generative AI, in particular, technologies based on natural language processing (NLP), most significantly change work processes in finance, healthcare, education, retail, and the IT sector. It is expected that by 2030, the share of tasks performed exclusively by humans will decrease from 47% to 33%, and the share of automated tasks will increase from 22% to 33%. The report notes a change in the paradigm of future human-machine work. Interaction between humans, machines, and algorithms changes work roles in various fields. It is expected that automation will lead to changes in the way people work, and the proportional share of tasks performed exclusively or primarily by humans will decrease as technologies become more universal.\n",

The lab is pioneering new construction practices, including modular, robotic, and AI-driven methods. Professor Tony Yang said, 'We can ensure these new-generation buildings are smarter, more resilient, more carbon-neutral and, in fact, more economical to build.' The lab's innovations could help Canada meet its goal of building 3.9 million new homes by 2031. Yang believes that the technology could result in similar time and cost savings as seen in China, where a 15-storey building can be constructed in just one week. The goal of automation is not to replace construction workers, but to deploy them more efficiently and productively. Yang also noted B.C.'s shortage of skilled construction labour, which the new technology can help alleviate. The lab has already partnered with Rogers Communications Inc. to develop next-generation communication protocols and plans to build out a production line and supply chain to allow its new methods to be implemented and tested on a larger scale.\\nOriginal language: en\\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 02:02 AM\\nSource:[Castanet](https://www.castanet.net/news/BC/536433/AI-powered-robotics-are-building-smarter-structures-in-B-C-s-backyard)\\n\\n**The Future of Jobs: What's Coming by 2030 and How to Get Ready**\\nThe Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts a net gain of 78 million jobs by 2030, with 170 million new gigs created and 92 million that will disappear.

It is predicted that in the next five years, most work in these areas will shift towards automation. The report notes that many public sector workflows are currently manual, but it is expected that two-thirds of work will be automated in the next five years, significantly impacting work methods and daily tool usage. Natasha Friis Saxberg, executive director of the Danish IT industry association, stated, 'Many companies will delegate AI learning to employees, but as AI technology rapidly develops, companies must accelerate employee skill upgrades, or they will be surpassed by global competitors.' \\nOriginal language: zh\\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 02:15 AM\\nSource:[MoneyDJ理財網](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=f418d34b-9368-488d-a209-3c859d7e1cfb)\\n\\n**Bill Gates Recommends Book on AI, Predicts Massive Changes in Jobs**\\nBill Gates believes that everyone should read his favorite book on artificial intelligence, which predicts that AI will change the shape of most jobs in almost every industry within the next five years, according to a report by CBS News. The book, 'The Next Wave: Technology and Power and the Greatest Challenge of the 21st Century', was written by Mustafa Suleyman, a pioneer in AI and the founder of the research lab DeepMind, which was sold to Google in 2014 and is now the executive director of Microsoft AI. Gates wrote on his blog last month: 'It is the book that I recommend more than any other book on AI - to heads of state, business leaders, and anyone else who asks - because it provides something rare: a clear vision of both the extraordinary opportunities and the real risks of the future.' In the book, Suleyman predicts that the rapid development of AI will change the way almost every industry works. He cites a 2023 study by McKinsey, which estimated that nearly half of all 'work activities' will become automated by 2030. Suleyman writes that the consequences of AI will be 'extremely destabilizing' for hundreds of millions of people who will need, at the very least, to be retrained and transition to new types of work. According to McKinsey, more than 400 million workers worldwide may need to transition to new jobs or roles. Suleyman says that AI will help workers become more efficient, as it already has in some cases, but only initially. He explains that 'these tools will only augment human intelligence temporarily. They will make us more intelligent and efficient for a while, and they will open up huge amounts of economic growth, but they will replace labor essentially.' How to prepare for the impact of AI on the workforce? Suleyman notes that from 'physical manufacturing' to 'cognitive work', the AI revolution will touch almost every industry. In the end, there will be 'few areas' where humans will be able to surpass machines. AI will quickly surpass human workers in office tasks such as administration, customer service, and content creation, according to Suleyman. He points out that the increase in inputs is likely to lead to a reality where employers will create millions of new jobs in response to economic growth. However, Suleyman notes that all this work will not go to humans: employers will choose 'very low-cost incentives' whenever possible. Some jobs are harder for AI to replicate. These include skilled trades such as plumbers and electricians, as well as office roles that rely heavily on social skills, critical thinking, and creativity. However, it is likely that everyone will need to upgrade their skills - and learn how to integrate this type of technology into their current jobs, as AI services spread across all industries over the coming years. Suleyman writes that many others will need to transition to entirely new jobs. This transformation is already underway. In 2023, a survey by EY found that 41% of American companies surveyed were implementing plans to train employees to work with AI products. According to a survey by Slack Workforce Lab in March 2024 of over 10,000 professionals, the key AI skills - such as rapid prototyping, machine learning, and data literacy - are a major factor in hiring for nearly 70% of employers. The massive challenge posed by AI to jobs. Some experts suggest that the economic benefits of AI will create enough new jobs to outweigh those lost. AI will create 78 million more jobs than it replaces by 2030, and the future of work will revolve around collaboration between humans and machines, according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2025 report earlier this year. Even the optimists about AI agree that the massive changes in how people work are likely to lead to a period of dramatic transformation. In his book, Suleyman predicts that the new jobs enabled by AI developments will not come soon enough to save large parts of the global workforce. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion with MIT President Sally Kornbluth in May 2024 that AI 'will kill a lot of current jobs, (and) there will be categories of jobs that will disappear completely.' 'Innovative treatments' and 'innovative solutions' and other benefits. Suleyman and Gates remain generally optimistic about the ability of AI to change people's lives for the better. Gates wrote last month that if workers and leaders prepare for massive changes, everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of 'innovative treatments for deadly diseases, innovative solutions to climate change, and high-quality education for all.' To achieve this better scenario, humans need to adopt AI by learning how to work with new technologies while implementing them in their daily lives and careers. This can start by exploring free online AI services such as 'Chat GPT' or other large language models that use AI. More advanced options include taking online courses to learn AI skills such as rapid prototyping. Suleyman emphasizes that 'this is a massive challenge that will determine, without exaggeration, the quality and nature of life in this century and the next.'\\nOriginal language: ar\\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 08:46 AM\\nSource:[صحيفة الشرق الأوسط](https://aawsat.com/node/5104271)\\n\\n**AI Boom: China Leads the World in AI Research, Japan Lags Behind**\\nThe current state of AI is chaotic, with numerous scientific papers, patents, and startup funding. This article uses three types of data - scientific papers, patents, and startup funding - to analyze the situation and predict the future of AI by 2030. The fourth AI boom, triggered by the emergence of ChatGPT, is a significant milestone surpassing the third boom of the 2000s. According to the Scopus database, which contains over 99 million papers from over 7,000 publishers, AI-related papers have grown from 8,833 in 2014 to over 210,000 in 2023, accounting for 5% of all papers. China leads the world in AI-related papers, followed by the US and India.

A significant part of the report is dedicated to the role of artificial intelligence in the world's workforce. According to the report, the most significant trends in the labor market in 2025-2030 are: technological advancements, economic turbulence, green energy, lack of security, and an aging population. The report is based on surveys of over 1,000 employers representing over 14 million workers in 22 industry clusters and 55 economies worldwide. The authors of the report also collaborated with platforms such as Coursera, LinkedIn, and Indeed to supplement the survey results with real data on employment trends. The report predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 170 million new jobs created, with AI playing a key role. However, 92 million roles will be replaced, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs. Technological changes remain the main driver of changes, with the expansion of digital access creating and displacing more jobs than any other macro-trend. AI and information technologies can provide 11 million new jobs, despite the expected displacement of 9 million. Meanwhile, robotics and autonomous systems will become the largest reducer, reducing the number of jobs by 5 million. For example, since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investment in AI has increased by almost eight times, accompanied by increased funding for server infrastructure and energy systems to support AI systems. Although information technologies are leaders in the implementation of AI, the real sector of the economy, including industries such as construction and manufacturing, lags behind. Generative AI, in particular, technologies based on natural language processing (NLP), most significantly change work processes in finance, healthcare, education, retail, and the IT sector. It is expected that by 2030, the share of tasks performed exclusively by humans will decrease from 47% to 33%, and the share of automated tasks will increase from 22% to 33%. The report notes a change in the paradigm of future human-machine work. Interaction between humans, machines, and algorithms changes work roles in various fields. It is expected that automation will lead to changes in the way people work, and the proportional share of tasks performed exclusively or primarily by humans will decrease as technologies become more universal.\\nOriginal language: uk\\nPublish date: January 15, 2025 07:23 AM\\nSource:[speka.media](https://speka.media/bilse-robocix-misc-ci-skorocennya-yak-stucnii-intelekt-vplivatime-na-zainyatist-9xrdl5)\\n\\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, WEF Study Finds**\\nAccording to a World Economic Forum (WEF) study, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to create 170 million new job openings by 2030.

The report states that by 2030, the interaction between humans and machines will 'change dramatically', with 47% of tasks currently performed by humans and only 30% involving collaboration with machines, being practically balanced. The report recommends designing technologies that complement human work rather than replacing it, and establishing a collaborative relationship between humans and machines. The report also projects that the global labor market will experience a structural change equivalent to 22% of current employment, resulting in the creation of 170 million new jobs and the elimination of 92 million, with a net positive balance.

According to Ars Technica, this projection refers to data projected for 2030. While 40% of companies plan to reduce their workforce due to AI automation, 50% aim to adapt their operations to this technology. As a result, two-thirds of companies plan to hire specialized talent in AI, with the most in-demand skills being experience with generative AI, big data, networks, cybersecurity, and technological literacy. The report highlights that 86% of companies expect AI to transform their operations by 2030, making it the technology with the greatest potential to generate jobs. However, this AI boom has a negative impact on certain job categories, such as postal services, executive secretaries, payroll personnel, graphic designers, and even legal secretaries, which are declining due to the adoption of AI and other technological trends. The report emphasizes that human-machine collaboration will define future work environments, with 77% of companies launching training programs to enable their employees to work effectively with AI systems by 2030. As a result, 70% of companies will seek specialists in AI tool design, while 62% will hire employees trained to work alongside these systems.

According to the WEF Future of Jobs report, 41% of companies plan to slash their workforce by 2030 in response to AI's increasing capabilities. However, 77% of companies are preparing to reskill and upskill their existing staff for better human-machine collaboration. The report predicts that skills in AI, big data, and cybersecurity will be in high demand. 'Trends such as generative AI and rapid technological shifts are upending industries and labor markets, creating both unprecedented opportunities and profound risks,' said Till Leopold, the head of Work, Wages and Job Creation at the WEF. The report identified job categories that will face the largest decline in numbers due to AI, including service clerks, executive secretaries, payroll clerks, and graphic designers. However, the WEF stressed that the impact of AI extends beyond job displacement, highlighting the potential of the technology to augment human output. 'Human-centered skills' such as creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and agility will continue to be critical. 'Everything a human is capable of doing can be done by AI, and machines can do it well,' said Daniil Gavrilov, the head of the Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory at T-Bank AI Research.\\nOriginal language: en\\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 09:58 AM\\nSource:[RT](https://www.rt.com/news/610662-ai-labor-market/)\\n\\n**These jobs will disappear fastest by 2030 as AI rises, according to the World Economic Forum**\\nAccording to the World Economic Forum (WEF), the rise of AI will lead to a net growth of 78 million jobs by 2030, with 170 million new jobs created, equivalent to 14% of current employment. However, this growth will be offset by the loss of 92 million jobs, amounting to 22% of today's total jobs. The report, based on data from over 1,000 leading global employers, highlights technological advancements, demographic shifts, geo-economic tensions, economic uncertainty, and the green transition as key drivers of these changes.\\nOriginal language: en\\nPublish date: January 08, 2025 10:11 PM\\nSource:[Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/91256947/jobs-most-at-risk-fastest-growing-declining-by-2030-ai-wef-world-economic-forum)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# FORECASTS\\n\\n## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning\\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The question resolves by the end of 2030, so there are approximately 5 years and 9 months remaining until the outcome is known.\\n\\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: As of now, there are no new AI labs that have become leading labs within 2 years of their founding since the question's launch. Therefore, the status quo outcome would be '0 or 1'.\\n\\n(c) A description of a scenario that results in an unexpected outcome: An unexpected outcome could occur if there is a significant breakthrough in AI technology that lowers the barriers to entry for new AI labs. This could lead to a surge in the number of new labs being founded, some of which might quickly rise to prominence due to their innovative approaches or partnerships with major tech companies. Additionally, geopolitical factors or substantial investments from non-traditional tech regions could lead to the rapid emergence of new leading AI labs.\\n\\nRationale:\\n1. **Status Quo Bias**: The current leading AI labs have established themselves with significant resources, talent, and data. The status quo suggests that it is challenging for new labs to quickly ascend to the top 5 within two years of their founding. Thus, the '0 or 1' option should be given significant weight.\\n\\n2. **Potential for New Entrants**: The AI field is dynamic, with considerable interest and investment. While the barriers to becoming a leading lab are high, the rapid pace of AI advancements and the potential for disruptive innovations mean that some new labs could emerge as leaders. This justifies assigning moderate probabilities to the '2 or 3' and '4 or 5' options.\\n\\n3. **Uncertainty and Unexpected Outcomes**: The AI landscape could change dramatically due to unforeseen technological breakthroughs, regulatory changes, or shifts in funding patterns. This warrants assigning some probability to the higher options ('6 or 7', '8 or 9', '10 or more'), although these remain less likely given the current context.\\n\\nFinal probabilities:\\n- Option_0 or 1: 50%\\n- Option_2 or 3: 25%\\n- Option_4 or 5: 15%\\n- Option_6 or 7: 5%\\n- Option_8 or 9: 3%\\n- Option_10 or more: 2%\\n\\n\\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 years, as the question resolves by the end of 2029.\\n\\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be '0 or 1'. This is because, historically, the establishment of leading AI labs has been a slow process, with only a few new labs achieving top-tier status within a short timeframe. The current leading labs, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, have established significant technological and resource advantages that new entrants would find challenging to overcome quickly.\\n\\n(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a major technological breakthrough or a significant shift in the AI landscape. For example, if a new AI paradigm emerges that drastically changes the competitive dynamics, it could enable several new labs to leapfrog existing leaders. Additionally, substantial investment from major tech companies or governments into new AI ventures could accelerate their development and elevate them to leading status within a short period.\\n\\nRationale:\\n1. **Status Quo Bias**: The current leading AI labs have significant advantages in terms of resources, talent, and existing technological infrastructure. These factors create high barriers to entry for new labs aiming to become leading players within a short timeframe.\\n\\n2. **Historical Precedent**: Historically, the emergence of new leading AI labs has been infrequent. While there have been some notable new entrants, such as Anthropic, these are exceptions rather than the norm. The AI field is highly competitive, and achieving a top 5 status requires substantial innovation and resources.\\n\\n3. **Potential for Disruption**: While the status quo is a strong predictor, the AI field is dynamic and subject to rapid changes. New breakthroughs or shifts in funding and strategic priorities could lead to unexpected outcomes. For instance, if a new AI technology emerges that significantly outperforms current models, it could enable new labs to rise quickly.\\n\\n4. **Investment and Talent**: The influx of investment and talent into AI, as indicated by the establishment of new labs like xAI and Mistral, suggests that there is potential for disruption. However, translating this potential into top-tier status within two years is a significant challenge.\\n\\n5. **Moderate Probability for Unexpected Outcomes**: Given the dynamic nature of AI and the potential for rapid technological advancements, it is prudent to assign some probability to scenarios where multiple new labs become leading players.\\n\\nFinal Probabilities:\\n- Option_0_or_1: 50%\\n- Option_2_or_3: 25%\\n- Option_4_or_5: 15%\\n- Option_6_or_7: 5%\\n- Option_8_or_9: 3%\\n- Option_10_or_more: 2%\\n\\n\\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 years, as the question resolves by the end of 2029.\\n\\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be '0 or 1'. Currently, the leading AI labs are well-established entities with significant resources, expertise, and market presence. The barriers to becoming a leading AI lab are high, and new entrants would need to achieve substantial technological advancements or breakthroughs to compete with existing leaders.\\n\\n(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a major technological breakthrough in AI that significantly lowers the barriers to entry, allowing new labs to quickly develop competitive models. For example, a new open-source AI framework could emerge, enabling smaller teams to rapidly iterate and improve their models, thereby challenging the dominance of established labs. Additionally, significant geopolitical shifts or regulatory changes could incentivize the rapid establishment and growth of new AI labs in certain regions.\\n\\nRationale:\\n1. **Status Quo Weighting**: The current landscape of AI labs is dominated by a few large players with substantial resources and expertise. The development and deployment of leading AI models require significant investment, talent, and infrastructure, which are typically accessible to established companies. Therefore, the status quo suggests a low number of new labs becoming leading labs.\\n\\n2. **Barriers to Entry**: The AI field is highly competitive, with established labs continuously advancing their models. New entrants would need to offer something significantly different or superior to gain a foothold. This makes it challenging for new labs to quickly rise to the top within two years of founding.\\n\\n3. **Potential for Disruption**: While the barriers are high, the AI field is also characterized by rapid innovation. Disruptive technologies or business models could enable new labs to emerge as leaders. For example, breakthroughs in AI efficiency, new funding models, or strategic partnerships could accelerate the rise of new labs.\\n\\n4. **Moderate Probability for Unexpected Outcomes**: Given the rapid pace of technological change and the potential for unforeseen developments, it is prudent to assign some probability to higher numbers of new leading labs. This accounts for the possibility of significant disruptions or shifts in the AI landscape.\\n\\nFinal Probabilities:\\n- Option_0 or 1: 50%\\n- Option_2 or 3: 25%\\n- Option_4 or 5: 15%\\n- Option_6 or 7: 5%\\n- Option_8 or 9: 3%\\n- Option_10 or more: 2%\\n\\n\\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The question asks about events occurring before 2030, and today is March 4, 2025. Therefore, there are approximately 5 years and 10 months left until the outcome is known.\\n\\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: As of now, the leading AI labs are OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Cohere, and Mistral AI. If no new AI labs were to emerge as leading labs within two years of their founding, the status quo outcome would be '0 or 1' new leading AI labs.\\n\\n(c) A description of a scenario that results in an unexpected outcome: An unexpected outcome could occur if there is a significant breakthrough in AI technology that lowers the barrier to entry for new labs to develop competitive models quickly. This could be facilitated by open-source advancements, a surge in AI talent due to global educational initiatives, or a major geopolitical shift that results in substantial funding and support for AI startups. Additionally, if a major AI lab were to split into multiple entities, each rapidly developing competitive models, this could lead to more new labs becoming leading labs.\\n\\nRationale:\\n1. The status quo suggests that becoming a leading AI lab is challenging and typically requires significant resources, talent, and time. Given the current landscape, it is reasonable to expect that only a few new labs might achieve this status quickly.\\n\\n2. However, the AI field is dynamic, and the rapid pace of technological advancement could lead to unexpected developments. The presence of influential figures like Elon Musk and the potential for significant investment in new ventures could lead to more new labs emerging as leaders.\\n\\n3. The historical trend of labs splitting and forming new entities, as seen with Anthropic and Udio, suggests that internal dynamics within existing labs could contribute to the emergence of new leading labs.\\n\\n4. While the number of leading labs is limited to the top five, the competitive nature of the AI field means that new entrants have a chance to disrupt the current hierarchy, especially if they bring innovative approaches or technologies.\\n\\n5. Considering the potential for unexpected developments and the competitive nature of the AI field, it is prudent to leave some probability for higher numbers of new leading labs.\\n\\nFinal probabilities:\\nOption_0_or_1: 40%\\nOption_2_or_3: 30%\\nOption_4_or_5: 15%\\nOption_6_or_7: 8%\\nOption_8_or_9: 5%\\nOption_10_or_more: 2%\\n\\n\\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 years, as the question resolves by the end of 2030.\\n\\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be '0 or 1'. This is based on the current landscape where a few key players dominate the AI space, and new labs becoming leading labs within two years of their founding is relatively rare. The existing top labs have significant resources, talent, and established reputations, making it challenging for new entrants to quickly rise to the top 5.\\n\\n(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a major breakthrough in AI technology that significantly lowers the barriers to entry for new labs. For example, if a new open-source AI framework were developed that drastically reduces the time and cost required to develop competitive AI models, we might see a surge in new labs rapidly achieving leading status. Additionally, geopolitical shifts or major investments from non-traditional tech regions could lead to the rapid emergence of new leading labs.\\n\\nRationale:\\n1. The status quo heavily favors established players due to their existing infrastructure, talent pool, and financial resources.\\n2. The AI field is highly competitive, and while new labs are emerging, reaching the top 5 within two years is a significant challenge.\\n3. Historical trends suggest that while new labs do emerge, only a few manage to become leading labs quickly.\\n4. However, the fast pace of AI development and potential for disruptive innovations means that we should not entirely discount the possibility of multiple new labs achieving leading status.\\n\\nFinal probabilities:\\n- 0 or 1: 50%\\n- 2 or 3: 25%\\n- 4 or 5: 15%\\n- 6 or 7: 5%\\n- 8 or 9: 3%\\n- 10 or more: 2%\\n\\n\", other_notes=None, price_estimate=0.07468154999999999, minutes_taken=0.543780525525411, errors=[], prediction=PredictedOptionList(predicted_options=[PredictedOption(option_name='0 or 1', probability=0.48), PredictedOption(option_name='2 or 3', probability=0.26), PredictedOption(option_name='4 or 5', probability=0.15), PredictedOption(option_name='6 or 7', probability=0.05600000000000001), PredictedOption(option_name='8 or 9', probability=0.033999999999999996), PredictedOption(option_name='10 or more', probability=0.02)]))]\n",

The lab is pioneering new construction practices, including modular, robotic, and AI-driven methods. Professor Tony Yang said, 'We can ensure these new-generation buildings are smarter, more resilient, more carbon-neutral and, in fact, more economical to build.' The lab's innovations could help Canada meet its goal of building 3.9 million new homes by 2031. Yang believes that the technology could result in similar time and cost savings as seen in China, where a 15-storey building can be constructed in just one week. The goal of automation is not to replace construction workers, but to deploy them more efficiently and productively. Yang also noted B.C.'s shortage of skilled construction labour, which the new technology can help alleviate. The lab has already partnered with Rogers Communications Inc. to develop next-generation communication protocols and plans to build out a production line and supply chain to allow its new methods to be implemented and tested on a larger scale.\\nOriginal language: en\\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 02:02 AM\\nSource:[Castanet](https://www.castanet.net/news/BC/536433/AI-powered-robotics-are-building-smarter-structures-in-B-C-s-backyard)\\n\\n**The Future of Jobs: What's Coming by 2030 and How to Get Ready**\\nThe Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts a net gain of 78 million jobs by 2030, with 170 million new gigs created and 92 million that will disappear.

It is predicted that in the next five years, most work in these areas will shift towards automation. The report notes that many public sector workflows are currently manual, but it is expected that two-thirds of work will be automated in the next five years, significantly impacting work methods and daily tool usage. Natasha Friis Saxberg, executive director of the Danish IT industry association, stated, 'Many companies will delegate AI learning to employees, but as AI technology rapidly develops, companies must accelerate employee skill upgrades, or they will be surpassed by global competitors.' \\nOriginal language: zh\\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 02:15 AM\\nSource:[MoneyDJ理財網](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=f418d34b-9368-488d-a209-3c859d7e1cfb)\\n\\n**Bill Gates Recommends Book on AI, Predicts Massive Changes in Jobs**\\nBill Gates believes that everyone should read his favorite book on artificial intelligence, which predicts that AI will change the shape of most jobs in almost every industry within the next five years, according to a report by CBS News. The book, 'The Next Wave: Technology and Power and the Greatest Challenge of the 21st Century', was written by Mustafa Suleyman, a pioneer in AI and the founder of the research lab DeepMind, which was sold to Google in 2014 and is now the executive director of Microsoft AI. Gates wrote on his blog last month: 'It is the book that I recommend more than any other book on AI - to heads of state, business leaders, and anyone else who asks - because it provides something rare: a clear vision of both the extraordinary opportunities and the real risks of the future.' In the book, Suleyman predicts that the rapid development of AI will change the way almost every industry works. He cites a 2023 study by McKinsey, which estimated that nearly half of all 'work activities' will become automated by 2030. Suleyman writes that the consequences of AI will be 'extremely destabilizing' for hundreds of millions of people who will need, at the very least, to be retrained and transition to new types of work. According to McKinsey, more than 400 million workers worldwide may need to transition to new jobs or roles. Suleyman says that AI will help workers become more efficient, as it already has in some cases, but only initially. He explains that 'these tools will only augment human intelligence temporarily. They will make us more intelligent and efficient for a while, and they will open up huge amounts of economic growth, but they will replace labor essentially.' How to prepare for the impact of AI on the workforce? Suleyman notes that from 'physical manufacturing' to 'cognitive work', the AI revolution will touch almost every industry. In the end, there will be 'few areas' where humans will be able to surpass machines. AI will quickly surpass human workers in office tasks such as administration, customer service, and content creation, according to Suleyman. He points out that the increase in inputs is likely to lead to a reality where employers will create millions of new jobs in response to economic growth. However, Suleyman notes that all this work will not go to humans: employers will choose 'very low-cost incentives' whenever possible. Some jobs are harder for AI to replicate. These include skilled trades such as plumbers and electricians, as well as office roles that rely heavily on social skills, critical thinking, and creativity. However, it is likely that everyone will need to upgrade their skills - and learn how to integrate this type of technology into their current jobs, as AI services spread across all industries over the coming years. Suleyman writes that many others will need to transition to entirely new jobs. This transformation is already underway. In 2023, a survey by EY found that 41% of American companies surveyed were implementing plans to train employees to work with AI products. According to a survey by Slack Workforce Lab in March 2024 of over 10,000 professionals, the key AI skills - such as rapid prototyping, machine learning, and data literacy - are a major factor in hiring for nearly 70% of employers. The massive challenge posed by AI to jobs. Some experts suggest that the economic benefits of AI will create enough new jobs to outweigh those lost. AI will create 78 million more jobs than it replaces by 2030, and the future of work will revolve around collaboration between humans and machines, according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2025 report earlier this year. Even the optimists about AI agree that the massive changes in how people work are likely to lead to a period of dramatic transformation. In his book, Suleyman predicts that the new jobs enabled by AI developments will not come soon enough to save large parts of the global workforce. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion with MIT President Sally Kornbluth in May 2024 that AI 'will kill a lot of current jobs, (and) there will be categories of jobs that will disappear completely.' 'Innovative treatments' and 'innovative solutions' and other benefits. Suleyman and Gates remain generally optimistic about the ability of AI to change people's lives for the better. Gates wrote last month that if workers and leaders prepare for massive changes, everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of 'innovative treatments for deadly diseases, innovative solutions to climate change, and high-quality education for all.' To achieve this better scenario, humans need to adopt AI by learning how to work with new technologies while implementing them in their daily lives and careers. This can start by exploring free online AI services such as 'Chat GPT' or other large language models that use AI. More advanced options include taking online courses to learn AI skills such as rapid prototyping. Suleyman emphasizes that 'this is a massive challenge that will determine, without exaggeration, the quality and nature of life in this century and the next.'\\nOriginal language: ar\\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 08:46 AM\\nSource:[صحيفة الشرق الأوسط](https://aawsat.com/node/5104271)\\n\\n**AI Boom: China Leads the World in AI Research, Japan Lags Behind**\\nThe current state of AI is chaotic, with numerous scientific papers, patents, and startup funding. This article uses three types of data - scientific papers, patents, and startup funding - to analyze the situation and predict the future of AI by 2030. The fourth AI boom, triggered by the emergence of ChatGPT, is a significant milestone surpassing the third boom of the 2000s. According to the Scopus database, which contains over 99 million papers from over 7,000 publishers, AI-related papers have grown from 8,833 in 2014 to over 210,000 in 2023, accounting for 5% of all papers. China leads the world in AI-related papers, followed by the US and India. Japan ranks 10th and its global share has decreased to 2.5% in 2023, indicating that it has not fully adapted to the AI boom.\\nOriginal language: ja\\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 08:01 PM\\nSource:[日経クロステック（xTECH）](https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/column/18/03055/122700002/)\\n\\n**Artificial Intelligence to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, Report Says**\\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) has recently released the Future of Jobs Report 2025, which extensively analyzes global trends in the labor market and predicts their impact on jobs, skills, and worker transformation strategies in 2025-2030. A significant part of the report is dedicated to the role of artificial intelligence in the world's workforce. According to the report, the most significant trends in the labor market in 2025-2030 are: technological advancements, economic turbulence, green energy, lack of security, and an aging population. The report is based on surveys of over 1,000 employers representing over 14 million workers in 22 industry clusters and 55 economies worldwide. The authors of the report also collaborated with platforms such as Coursera, LinkedIn, and Indeed to supplement the survey results with real data on employment trends. The report predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 170 million new jobs created, with AI playing a key role. However, 92 million roles will be replaced, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs. Technological changes remain the main driver of changes, with the expansion of digital access creating and displacing more jobs than any other macro-trend. AI and information technologies can provide 11 million new jobs, despite the expected displacement of 9 million. Meanwhile, robotics and autonomous systems will become the largest reducer, reducing the number of jobs by 5 million. For example, since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investment in AI has increased by almost eight times, accompanied by increased funding for server infrastructure and energy systems to support AI systems. Although information technologies are leaders in the implementation of AI, the real sector of the economy, including industries such as construction and manufacturing, lags behind. Generative AI, in particular, technologies based on natural language processing (NLP), most significantly change work processes in finance, healthcare, education, retail, and the IT sector. It is expected that by 2030, the share of tasks performed exclusively by humans will decrease from 47% to 33%, and the share of automated tasks will increase from 22% to 33%. The report notes a change in the paradigm of future human-machine work. Interaction between humans, machines, and algorithms changes work roles in various fields. It is expected that automation will lead to changes in the way people work, and the proportional share of tasks performed exclusively or primarily by humans will decrease as technologies become more universal.\\nOriginal language: uk\\nPublish date: January 15, 2025 07:23 AM\\nSource:[speka.media](https://speka.media/bilse-robocix-misc-ci-skorocennya-yak-stucnii-intelekt-vplivatime-na-zainyatist-9xrdl5)\\n\\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, WEF Study Finds**\\nAccording to a World Economic Forum (WEF) study, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to create 170 million new job openings by 2030.

The study, conducted among 11,000 employers from 55 countries, found that despite the expected job loss, the net employment growth will be around 7%. This is due to approximately 8% of the workforce being redirected to new fields, requiring employees to adapt and retrain. In response to the challenges of AI implementation, 77% of employers expressed willingness to invest in employee upskilling. Additionally, over half of companies plan to restructure their business to integrate AI, and 65% intend to hire professionals with expertise in new technologies.

The report states that by 2030, the interaction between humans and machines will 'change dramatically', with 47% of tasks currently performed by humans and only 30% involving collaboration with machines, being practically balanced. The report recommends designing technologies that complement human work rather than replacing it, and establishing a collaborative relationship between humans and machines. The report also projects that the global labor market will experience a structural change equivalent to 22% of current employment, resulting in the creation of 170 million new jobs and the elimination of 92 million, with a net positive balance.

According to Ars Technica, this projection refers to data projected for 2030. While 40% of companies plan to reduce their workforce due to AI automation, 50% aim to adapt their operations to this technology. As a result, two-thirds of companies plan to hire specialized talent in AI, with the most in-demand skills being experience with generative AI, big data, networks, cybersecurity, and technological literacy. The report highlights that 86% of companies expect AI to transform their operations by 2030, making it the technology with the greatest potential to generate jobs. However, this AI boom has a negative impact on certain job categories, such as postal services, executive secretaries, payroll personnel, graphic designers, and even legal secretaries, which are declining due to the adoption of AI and other technological trends. The report emphasizes that human-machine collaboration will define future work environments, with 77% of companies launching training programs to enable their employees to work effectively with AI systems by 2030. As a result, 70% of companies will seek specialists in AI tool design, while 62% will hire employees trained to work alongside these systems.

'Trends such as generative AI and rapid technological shifts are upending industries and labor markets, creating both unprecedented opportunities and profound risks,' said Till Leopold, the head of Work, Wages and Job Creation at the WEF. The report identified job categories that will face the largest decline in numbers due to AI, including service clerks, executive secretaries, payroll clerks, and graphic designers. However, the WEF stressed that the impact of AI extends beyond job displacement, highlighting the potential of the technology to augment human output. 'Human-centered skills' such as creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and agility will continue to be critical. 'Everything a human is capable of doing can be done by AI, and machines can do it well,' said Daniil Gavrilov, the head of the Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory at T-Bank AI Research.\\nOriginal language: en\\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 09:58 AM\\nSource:[RT](https://www.rt.com/news/610662-ai-labor-market/)\\n\\n**These jobs will disappear fastest by 2030 as AI rises, according to the World Economic Forum**\\nAccording to the World Economic Forum (WEF), the rise of AI will lead to a net growth of 78 million jobs by 2030, with 170 million new jobs created, equivalent to 14% of current employment. However, this growth will be offset by the loss of 92 million jobs, amounting to 22% of today's total jobs. The report, based on data from over 1,000 leading global employers, highlights technological advancements, demographic shifts, geo-economic tensions, economic uncertainty, and the green transition as key drivers of these changes.\\nOriginal language: en\\nPublish date: January 08, 2025 10:11 PM\\nSource:[Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/91256947/jobs-most-at-risk-fastest-growing-declining-by-2030-ai-wef-world-economic-forum)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# FORECASTS\\n\\n## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning\\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The question resolves by the end of 2030, so there are approximately 5 years and 9 months remaining until the outcome is known.\\n\\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: As of now, there are no new AI labs that have become leading labs within 2 years of their founding since the question's launch. Therefore, the status quo outcome would be '0 or 1'.\\n\\n(c) A description of a scenario that results in an unexpected outcome: An unexpected outcome could occur if there is a significant breakthrough in AI technology that lowers the barriers to entry for new AI labs. This could lead to a surge in the number of new labs being founded, some of which might quickly rise to prominence due to their innovative approaches or partnerships with major tech companies. Additionally, geopolitical factors or substantial investments from non-traditional tech regions could lead to the rapid emergence of new leading AI labs.\\n\\nRationale:\\n1. **Status Quo Bias**: The current leading AI labs have established themselves with significant resources, talent, and data. The status quo suggests that it is challenging for new labs to quickly ascend to the top 5 within two years of their founding. Thus, the '0 or 1' option should be given significant weight.\\n\\n2. **Potential for New Entrants**: The AI field is dynamic, with considerable interest and investment. While the barriers to becoming a leading lab are high, the rapid pace of AI advancements and the potential for disruptive innovations mean that some new labs could emerge as leaders. This justifies assigning moderate probabilities to the '2 or 3' and '4 or 5' options.\\n\\n3. **Uncertainty and Unexpected Outcomes**: The AI landscape could change dramatically due to unforeseen technological breakthroughs, regulatory changes, or shifts in funding patterns. This warrants assigning some probability to the higher options ('6 or 7', '8 or 9', '10 or more'), although these remain less likely given the current context.\\n\\nFinal probabilities:\\n- Option_0 or 1: 50%\\n- Option_2 or 3: 25%\\n- Option_4 or 5: 15%\\n- Option_6 or 7: 5%\\n- Option_8 or 9: 3%\\n- Option_10 or more: 2%\\n\\n\\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 years, as the question resolves by the end of 2029.\\n\\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be '0 or 1'. This is because, historically, the establishment of leading AI labs has been a slow process, with only a few new labs achieving top-tier status within a short timeframe. The current leading labs, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, have established significant technological and resource advantages that new entrants would find challenging to overcome quickly.\\n\\n(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a major technological breakthrough or a significant shift in the AI landscape. For example, if a new AI paradigm emerges that drastically changes the competitive dynamics, it could enable several new labs to leapfrog existing leaders. Additionally, substantial investment from major tech companies or governments into new AI ventures could accelerate their development and elevate them to leading status within a short period.\\n\\nRationale:\\n1. **Status Quo Bias**: The current leading AI labs have significant advantages in terms of resources, talent, and existing technological infrastructure. These factors create high barriers to entry for new labs aiming to become leading players within a short timeframe.\\n\\n2. **Historical Precedent**: Historically, the emergence of new leading AI labs has been infrequent. While there have been some notable new entrants, such as Anthropic, these are exceptions rather than the norm. The AI field is highly competitive, and achieving a top 5 status requires substantial innovation and resources.\\n\\n3. **Potential for Disruption**: While the status quo is a strong predictor, the AI field is dynamic and subject to rapid changes. New breakthroughs or shifts in funding and strategic priorities could lead to unexpected outcomes. For instance, if a new AI technology emerges that significantly outperforms current models, it could enable new labs to rise quickly.\\n\\n4. **Investment and Talent**: The influx of investment and talent into AI, as indicated by the establishment of new labs like xAI and Mistral, suggests that there is potential for disruption. However, translating this potential into top-tier status within two years is a significant challenge.\\n\\n5. **Moderate Probability for Unexpected Outcomes**: Given the dynamic nature of AI and the potential for rapid technological advancements, it is prudent to assign some probability to scenarios where multiple new labs become leading players.\\n\\nFinal Probabilities:\\n- Option_0_or_1: 50%\\n- Option_2_or_3: 25%\\n- Option_4_or_5: 15%\\n- Option_6_or_7: 5%\\n- Option_8_or_9: 3%\\n- Option_10_or_more: 2%\\n\\n\\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 years, as the question resolves by the end of 2029.\\n\\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be '0 or 1'. Currently, the leading AI labs are well-established entities with significant resources, expertise, and market presence. The barriers to becoming a leading AI lab are high, and new entrants would need to achieve substantial technological advancements or breakthroughs to compete with existing leaders.\\n\\n(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a major technological breakthrough in AI that significantly lowers the barriers to entry, allowing new labs to quickly develop competitive models. For example, a new open-source AI framework could emerge, enabling smaller teams to rapidly iterate and improve their models, thereby challenging the dominance of established labs. Additionally, significant geopolitical shifts or regulatory changes could incentivize the rapid establishment and growth of new AI labs in certain regions.\\n\\nRationale:\\n1. **Status Quo Weighting**: The current landscape of AI labs is dominated by a few large players with substantial resources and expertise. The development and deployment of leading AI models require significant investment, talent, and infrastructure, which are typically accessible to established companies. Therefore, the status quo suggests a low number of new labs becoming leading labs.\\n\\n2. **Barriers to Entry**: The AI field is highly competitive, with established labs continuously advancing their models. New entrants would need to offer something significantly different or superior to gain a foothold. This makes it challenging for new labs to quickly rise to the top within two years of founding.\\n\\n3. **Potential for Disruption**: While the barriers are high, the AI field is also characterized by rapid innovation. Disruptive technologies or business models could enable new labs to emerge as leaders. For example, breakthroughs in AI efficiency, new funding models, or strategic partnerships could accelerate the rise of new labs.\\n\\n4. **Moderate Probability for Unexpected Outcomes**: Given the rapid pace of technological change and the potential for unforeseen developments, it is prudent to assign some probability to higher numbers of new leading labs. This accounts for the possibility of significant disruptions or shifts in the AI landscape.\\n\\nFinal Probabilities:\\n- Option_0 or 1: 50%\\n- Option_2 or 3: 25%\\n- Option_4 or 5: 15%\\n- Option_6 or 7: 5%\\n- Option_8 or 9: 3%\\n- Option_10 or more: 2%\\n\\n\\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The question asks about events occurring before 2030, and today is March 4, 2025. Therefore, there are approximately 5 years and 10 months left until the outcome is known.\\n\\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: As of now, the leading AI labs are OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Cohere, and Mistral AI. If no new AI labs were to emerge as leading labs within two years of their founding, the status quo outcome would be '0 or 1' new leading AI labs.\\n\\n(c) A description of a scenario that results in an unexpected outcome: An unexpected outcome could occur if there is a significant breakthrough in AI technology that lowers the barrier to entry for new labs to develop competitive models quickly. This could be facilitated by open-source advancements, a surge in AI talent due to global educational initiatives, or a major geopolitical shift that results in substantial funding and support for AI startups. Additionally, if a major AI lab were to split into multiple entities, each rapidly developing competitive models, this could lead to more new labs becoming leading labs.\\n\\nRationale:\\n1. The status quo suggests that becoming a leading AI lab is challenging and typically requires significant resources, talent, and time. Given the current landscape, it is reasonable to expect that only a few new labs might achieve this status quickly.\\n\\n2. However, the AI field is dynamic, and the rapid pace of technological advancement could lead to unexpected developments. The presence of influential figures like Elon Musk and the potential for significant investment in new ventures could lead to more new labs emerging as leaders.\\n\\n3. The historical trend of labs splitting and forming new entities, as seen with Anthropic and Udio, suggests that internal dynamics within existing labs could contribute to the emergence of new leading labs.\\n\\n4. While the number of leading labs is limited to the top five, the competitive nature of the AI field means that new entrants have a chance to disrupt the current hierarchy, especially if they bring innovative approaches or technologies.\\n\\n5. Considering the potential for unexpected developments and the competitive nature of the AI field, it is prudent to leave some probability for higher numbers of new leading labs.\\n\\nFinal probabilities:\\nOption_0_or_1: 40%\\nOption_2_or_3: 30%\\nOption_4_or_5: 15%\\nOption_6_or_7: 8%\\nOption_8_or_9: 5%\\nOption_10_or_more: 2%\\n\\n\\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 years, as the question resolves by the end of 2030.\\n\\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be '0 or 1'. This is based on the current landscape where a few key players dominate the AI space, and new labs becoming leading labs within two years of their founding is relatively rare. The existing top labs have significant resources, talent, and established reputations, making it challenging for new entrants to quickly rise to the top 5.\\n\\n(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a major breakthrough in AI technology that significantly lowers the barriers to entry for new labs. For example, if a new open-source AI framework were developed that drastically reduces the time and cost required to develop competitive AI models, we might see a surge in new labs rapidly achieving leading status. Additionally, geopolitical shifts or major investments from non-traditional tech regions could lead to the rapid emergence of new leading labs.\\n\\nRationale:\\n1. The status quo heavily favors established players due to their existing infrastructure, talent pool, and financial resources.\\n2. The AI field is highly competitive, and while new labs are emerging, reaching the top 5 within two years is a significant challenge.\\n3. Historical trends suggest that while new labs do emerge, only a few manage to become leading labs quickly.\\n4. However, the fast pace of AI development and potential for disruptive innovations means that we should not entirely discount the possibility of multiple new labs achieving leading status.\\n\\nFinal probabilities:\\n- 0 or 1: 50%\\n- 2 or 3: 25%\\n- 4 or 5: 15%\\n- 6 or 7: 5%\\n- 8 or 9: 3%\\n- 10 or more: 2%\\n\\n\", other_notes=None, price_estimate=0.07468154999999999, minutes_taken=0.543780525525411, errors=[], prediction=PredictedOptionList(predicted_options=[PredictedOption(option_name='0 or 1', probability=0.48), PredictedOption(option_name='2 or 3', probability=0.26), PredictedOption(option_name='4 or 5', probability=0.15), PredictedOption(option_name='6 or 7', probability=0.05600000000000001), PredictedOption(option_name='8 or 9', probability=0.033999999999999996), PredictedOption(option_name='10 or more', probability=0.02)]))]\n",
