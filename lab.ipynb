      "**Elon Musk: AI Threat to Humanity is 'Low', but Existential Risk Remains**\n",
      "Elon Musk expressed cautious optimism about the future of humanity in the face of artificial intelligence, stating that the probability of human extinction due to AI is less than 20%, which he considers 'low'. However, he believes that the potential benefits of AI are significant, with an 80% chance of achieving a positive outcome. Musk has previously estimated the probability of human extinction due to AI to be between 10% and 20%. He predicts that AI will surpass human intelligence within one or two years, and by 2029 or 2030, AI will be 'smarter than all humans combined'. This aligns with his previous statements, although he has slightly extended the timeline. Musk remains convinced that AI poses an existential threat to humanity, saying 'I've always thought that AI would be much smarter than humans, and that it would be an existential threat, and that's now happening.' Other experts, such as Jeffrey Hinton, have expressed similar concerns, estimating a 10% chance of human extinction due to AI within the next 30 years. In contrast, researcher Roman Yampolskiy has estimated a 99.999999% chance of human extinction due to AI. Musk has been involved in the development of AI, co-founding OpenAI, but left the company after it shifted to a for-profit model. He has since created his own project, Grok, which he describes as an AI seeking to find the ultimate truth, even if it's politically incorrect.\n",

      "**Why we're heading for extinction - and much faster than you think**\n",
      "According to Henry Gee, a British palaeontologist, the human population is on a downward trend for the first time in history, and is projected to turn negative in 2086. Gee estimates that humans have about 10,000 years left before extinction. He attributes this to a combination of factors, including climate change, declining fertility rates, and the limited genetic variation in the human population. Gee suggests that humans have 'picked all the low hanging fruit' of resources required to maintain economic growth and a comfortable lifestyle, and that the declining fertility rate may be an 'inherent acknowledgement' of the threats posed by the climate emergency. He also notes that the human population is vulnerable to diseases due to its limited genetic variation, and that any particularly bad disease could wipe out millions of people. As Gee writes, 'as a species, humans are remarkably pox-ridden, worm-eaten and lousy.' \n",

      "**The 'Ice-Free' Arctic: A Dramatic Shift in the Climate**\n",
      "A recent study by a team of climate scientists led by Céline Heuzé from the University of Gothenburg and Alexandra Jahn from the University of Colorado Boulder suggests that the Arctic Ocean may experience its first 'ice-free' day as early as 2027. This would mean that the area covered by sea ice would drop to below one million square kilometers. The effects on the climate would be significant, as the ice acts as a thermostat for the planet, and its melting would accelerate global warming. The 'albedo effect' would cause the Arctic to warm four times faster than the global average. An ice-free Arctic could lead to significant changes in the jet stream and more frequent and intense weather events in mid-latitudes. The melting of Arctic ice could also open up new shipping routes, such as the Northern Sea Route, which could reduce travel time and fuel consumption between Asia and Europe. However, this would also increase the risk of environmental disasters, such as oil spills. The polar bears, which rely on sea ice for hunting and breeding, would be severely affected by the melting ice. Their habitats would shrink, and they would have to spend more time on land, where they would come into conflict with humans. The experts warn that if the current trend continues, the polar bears could become extinct by 2100. Immediate action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and increase environmental awareness to slow down this process. The changes in the Arctic are not only affecting the polar bears, but also the entire planet.\n",

      "Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and the world's richest man, is a strong supporter of artificial intelligence, but he believes there is a 20% chance that modern technology will lead to the extinction of humanity. Musk said in a podcast, 'The probability of achieving a good outcome is 80%, but there is a 20% chance that it will be the cause of humanity's extinction.' This is not the first time Musk has raised the possibility of humanity's demise, although he has previously estimated it to be between 10% and 20%.

However, some experts, such as Roman Yampolskiy, a researcher on AI safety and cybersecurity, believe that the probability of AI leading to humanity's extinction is 99.999999%. Despite his concerns about AI, Musk has said that he initially got involved in AI to create 'open-source, non-profit AI', and he was one of the 11 co-founders of the OpenAI company, which developed the ChatGPT program. However, Musk left the company and has since filed two lawsuits against OpenAI, which he claims has betrayed its mission by transitioning to a profit-driven model and partnering with Microsoft.\n",

      "**What if Dinosaurs Hadn't Gone Extinct?**\n",
      "Scientists debate the role of the asteroid in the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Many believe that their gradual extinction began earlier, and the cosmic stone only completed the process and accelerated it. But what if the extinction had not occurred? How would life have looked like, and could humans have emerged in a world where these giants dominated the planet? According to paleontologists, it is possible that dinosaurs would have continued to evolve and dominate the Earth if the catastrophe had not occurred. Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology at the University of Edinburgh, says that they survived and adapted for 165 million years, including surviving rises and falls in sea levels, temperature and CO2 levels in the atmosphere, and numerous volcanic eruptions. However, some scientists believe that dinosaurs would have eventually gone extinct due to their high extinction rates and the emergence of new species. If they had survived, it is likely that mammals would have remained small and not been able to compete with the dinosaurs. The emergence of humans would have been impossible, as it was made possible by a specific set of conditions that directed evolution. The asteroid impact that led to the extinction of dinosaurs created a chain of events that allowed mammals to evolve and eventually give rise to humans. If the asteroid had missed the Earth, it is likely that humans would not have emerged, or would have emerged much later. \n",

      "According to Professor Vaipayee, 10-40% of species could become extinct by 2100 if global warming causes a temperature increase of more than 2 degrees Celsius. This problem will become even more severe due to ocean acidification and rapid environmental changes. At the IIT Dhanbad, a lecture on collective extinction: past, present, and future was organized under the Centenary Lecture series. Professor Vaipayee said, 'Historically, there have been five major extinction events on Earth: Ordovician, Devonian, Permian, Triassic, and Cretaceous. These have had a profound impact on the Earth's biodiversity.' He warned that the current era is facing the sixth mass extinction, known as the Holocene or Anthropocene extinction, mainly due to human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, overexploitation of species, and climate change. He stated that the current extinction rate is 100 to 1,000 times higher than the natural background rate, posing a severe threat to global ecosystems.\n",

The study, published in January 2025 in the Journal of Applied Ecology, suggests that around 17,000 amphibians exist in the region, but they are the most threatened with extinction, as the protected areas currently correspond to less than 6% of the region. According to Santana, 'Until 2100, in an optimistic scenario, up to 80% of the species will be extinct, which would be an average of 13 of 74 species.' The researcher emphasizes that urgent measures are needed to reduce the damage caused over the past ten months, including increasing protected areas and reducing carbon emissions, which can be contributed by the population itself.\n",

      "**Will Human Traces on Earth Last Forever?**\n",
      "If humans were to become extinct, would our traces on Earth disappear with time? The answer is no, our traces will persist until the end of the Earth. However, to understand the details of our existence, it depends on the observation power of the next civilization and when they observe. Our traces are preserved in rocks, which are very hard and stable, and can be brought to the surface without being damaged. The oldest known biological evidence is found on zircon crystals, which have a history of 41 billion years. The characteristics of the 'human era' include the rapid extinction of species, the significant increase of carbon dioxide and other gases, the rapid consumption of natural resources, and the leaving of many geological records such as radioactive isotopes, plastic waste, and building materials. These characteristics are difficult to erase and can be easily discovered. Human underground traces will last for thousands of millions of years, including mine sites and city ruins, just like the dinosaur fossil site in Liaoning Province, China. Human fossils are also likely to be preserved, as humans live mainly in coastal areas and their distribution and population are relatively large. The preservation of human fossils will be longer than that of blue-green algae, which are very fragile but have been perfectly preserved for tens of billions of years. The geological traces left by human activity will last the longest, and plastic and nuclear usage traces may become more scattered over time, but will not disappear forever. In the future, if a civilization discovers our existence in the geological record, they will find the same traces all over the world. However, the Earth's existence may not be too long, and in tens of billions of years, the Sun will expand into a red giant and engulf the Earth. I believe that before the Sun engulfs the Earth, our existence will not disappear and will be easily discovered, but it will be harder to understand the details of our existence as time goes on.\n",

      "Researchers have used digital tools to explore how technology and climate change might shape human evolution. According to their studies, by 2100, humans may develop a 'text claw' grip, with hands molded into a claw-like shape due to prolonged smartphone use. Additionally, people may grow a second set of eyelids to filter out excess light from technology devices. Climate change could lead to humans growing webbed feet and bigger toes, as well as larger noses to warm cold air when inhaled. On the other hand, humans may live longer, grow taller, and develop a leaner build, with a more agreeable temperament and less aggressive behavior. However, their brains might shrink, making them less complex. As one researcher noted, 'We don't know what the climate will be like even 100 years from now or if technology and the sea levels rising will be the main reasons for evolution, but at least now we can start doing everything to stop global ecological problems in the future.'\n",

      "**The True Threat: Overpopulation, Not Climate Change**\n",
      "A 1960 study by physicist Heinz von Foerster and his team predicted that the world would reach a critical point on November 13, 2026, due to exponential population growth. According to their projections, the growth of the world population would be so significant that humanity would experience a collapse, not due to natural disasters or pandemics, but due to its own decisions and actions. The study, titled 'Doomsday: Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026', argued that even if a constant food supply and the avoidance of natural disasters were achieved, overpopulation could trigger the collapse of social and environmental systems. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that demographic growth has reached a pace that technological advancements cannot mitigate adequately. As a result, addressing this phenomenon is imperative to ensure a sustainable future. According to the model used, overpopulation will lead to extinction due to resource scarcity and the environmental impact of human activities. The research warned that if the world population continues to grow at this rate, we will reach an unsustainable threshold where societies cannot preserve their stability or sustainable development. Although this prediction is now viewed with skepticism, especially due to the stabilization of population growth rates, the dialogue about the limits of human growth remains relevant. The UN has estimated that the world population could reach 11.2 billion by 2100, raising questions about the management of the planet's resources and environmental protection in a world with a constantly increasing population.\n",

      "According to World One's calculations, the end of human civilization could occur between 2040 and 2050 due to the consequences of human activity. The reasons for human extinction include environmental pollution, global warming, greenhouse gases, and overpopulation. These problems are accumulating and exacerbating the state of our planet. By the predicted date, pollution will reach a level that will make life on Earth impossible, as confirmed by scientific calculations. Considering the current rate of pollution and increasing natural disasters, this scenario is quite plausible. A large number of people will die from lack of clean water, food, and air. The planet's population will decrease to the level of the 19th century, even if emissions are drastically reduced and birth control is implemented. World One used a complex algorithm and considered multiple factors. Some scientists agree with the computer's predictions. If humanity manages to survive in some form, it will be a completely different world. World One was created in 1973 for the Club of Rome, a center for global problem analysis.\n",

      "Elon Musk believes that humans will become extinct in Asia and Europe if birth rates do not increase. He made this statement in a post on the 'X' platform, in response to a proposal by Swedish journalist Peter Emanuelson, who suggested that tax exemptions for mothers in Europe should be implemented to encourage more children. Musk said, 'This is worth trying, we need to change something, or Europe and Asia and all the earth will disappear!' Musk has previously called for an increase in births to ensure the survival of humanity, saying 'If we don't increase births, the world will come to an end.' This warning comes after predictions that the world's population will decline for the first time in 2100, which will have significant economic and social impacts, according to the British Daily Express. Finally, the world's richest man, Musk, confirmed that 'people should have more children to ensure the survival of humans.'\n",

      "Elon Musk has expressed concern about the potential extinction of Europe and Asia, and most of the Earth's population, if something doesn't change. He tweeted, 'Worth a try. Something needs to change or Europe and Asia (and most of Earth) will disappear!' Musk, who has 11 children with three women, is actively working to prevent human extinction. According to a report by 'The Lancet', by 2050, more than three-quarters of the world's countries and territories (155 out of 204) will no longer have a sufficient birth rate to ensure normal population replacement. By 2100, this problem is expected to occur in 198 countries and territories, with 54% of the world's births occurring in Africa south of the Sahara desert. To ensure population replacement, the total fertility rate needs to be approximately 2.1, but 'The Lancet' predicts a rate of 1.8 by 2050 and 1.6 by 2100. Only six countries (Chad, Niger, Samoa, Somalia, Tajikistan, and Tonga) are expected to have a rate above 2.1 by the end of the century, while 13 countries will have a rate below 1.0. Western Europe is expected to have a rate of 1.44 by 2050 and 1.37 by 2100.\n",
